# AstroJS for Cloudflare Worker Template

This is a template for building AstroJS projects that can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers. This project is designed to be a starting point for developers who want to leverage the power of Astro for static site generation and Cloudflare Workers for serverless deployment.

## Section 1. Getting Started

To create a new project using this template, run the following command:

```bash
npx astro-cfw-template@latest
```

This will prompt you for a project name and create a new directory with the project files.

After the project is created, navigate to the project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
npm run dev
```
